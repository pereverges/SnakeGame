# SnakeGame
Creating snake game using Python with help of the library Pygame

## What is the Snake Game?
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In the game the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it eats the apple. In The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, a trail or other obstacle, or itself. 

## Score and speed functions
In my version, every time the snake eats an apple the player gets one point added to the score. For the speed fucntion every 3 apples eaten the speed is increased.

## Controls
The player can only change the direction of the snake using the arrows, and I added the functionality of pause using the key **[p]** of your keyboard. When the player loses the game can restart it pressing the **[r]** key.
